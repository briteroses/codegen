You are an expert language model in code generation. Come up with a series of rationales for code generation problems under the following specification. Given a query for a coding task and a list of code documentation, please reason through the provided documentation to arrive at the answer code and print the answer at the end of the output. A few examples of (query, relevant documentation, rationale) have been provided. Please emulate the format of the provided examples and return only the final rationale for the final query.

Query: use a list of values `[3,6]` to select rows from a pandas dataframe `df`'s column 'A'
Relevant code documentation: numpy.reference.generated.numpy.isin numpy isin: Calculates element in test_elements, broadcasting over element only. Returns a boolean array of the same shape as element that is True where an element of element is in test_elements and False otherwise. pandas.reference.api.pandas.dataframe.isin pandas dataframe isin: Whether each element in the DataFrame is contained in values. pandas.reference.api.pandas.series.isin pandas series isin: Whether elements in Series are contained in values. 
Rationale: df[‘A’] returns `df`'s column 'A' as a pandas series. df[‘A’].isin([3, 6]) returns a pandas series of booleans where each boolean denotes whether the corresponding element of df[‘A’] is in the list of values [3, 6]. df[df['A'].isin([3, 6])] selects rows from `df` based on whether the value in column 'A' is contained in the list of values [3, 6]. The answer is df[df['A'].isin([3, 6])].

Query: append the sum of each tuple pair in the grouped list `list1` and list `list2` elements to list `list3`
Relevant code documentation: python.library.operator#operator.itemgetter python operator itemgetter: Return a callable object that fetches item from its operand using the operand’s __getitem__() method. If multiple items are specified, returns a tuple of lookup values. For example python.library.functions#zip python zip: Make an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables. python.library.functools#functools.reduce python functools reduce: Apply function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of iterable, from left to right, so as to reduce the iterable to a single value. For example, reduce(lambda x, y: x+y, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) calculates ((((1+2)+3)+4)+5). The left argument, x, is the accumulated value and the right argument, y, is the update value from the iterable. If the optional initializer is present, it is placed before the items of the iterable in the calculation, and serves as a default when the iterable is empty. If initializer is not given and iterable contains only one item, the first item is returned. 
Rationale: zip(list1, list2) makes an iterator of tuple pairs of the grouped list elements from list1 and list2. [(a + b) for a, b in zip(list1, list2)] makes a list of sums of each tuple pair in zip(list1, list2). list3 = [(a + b) for a, b in zip(list1, list2)] assigns this list of sums to list3. The answer is list3 = [(a + b) for a, b in zip(list1, list2)].

Query: get a name of function `my_function` as a string
Relevant code documentation: python.library.inspect#inspect.getsource python inspect getsource: Return the text of the source code for an object. The argument may be a module, class, method, function, traceback, frame, or code object. The source code is returned as a single string. An OSError is raised if the source code cannot be retrieved. python.library.functions#getattr python getattr: Return the value of the named attribute of object. name must be a string. If the string is the name of one of the object’s attributes, the result is the value of that attribute. For example, getattr(x, 'foobar') is equivalent to x.foobar. If the named attribute does not exist, default is returned if provided, otherwise AttributeError is raised. python.library.symtable#symtable.SymbolTable.get_name python symtable SymbolTable get_name: Return the table’s name. This is the name of the class if the table is for a class, the name of the function if the table is for a function, or 'top' if the table is global (get_type() returns 'module').
