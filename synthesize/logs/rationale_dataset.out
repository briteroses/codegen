OpenAIError: ["You are an expert language model in code generation. Come up with a series of rationales for code generation problems under the following specification. Given a query for a coding task and a list of code documentation, please reason through the provided documentation to arrive at the answer code and print the answer at the end of the output. A few examples of (query, relevant documentation, rationale) have been provided. Please emulate the format of the provided examples and return only the final rationale for the final query.\n\nQuery: use a list of values `[3,6]` to select rows from a pandas dataframe `df`'s column 'A'\nRelevant code documentation: numpy.reference.generated.numpy.isin numpy isin: Calculates element in test_elements, broadcasting over element only. Returns a boolean array of the same shape as element that is True where an element of element is in test_elements and False otherwise. pandas.reference.api.pandas.dataframe.isin pandas dataframe isin: Whether each element in the DataFrame is contained in values. pandas.reference.api.pandas.series.isin pandas series isin: Whether elements in Series are contained in values. \nRationale: df[‘A’] returns `df`'s column 'A' as a pandas series. df[‘A’].isin([3, 6]) returns a pandas series of booleans where each boolean denotes whether the corresponding element of df[‘A’] is in the list of values [3, 6]. df[df['A'].isin([3, 6])] selects rows from `df` based on whether the value in column 'A' is contained in the list of values [3, 6]. The answer is df[df['A'].isin([3, 6])].\n\nQuery: append the sum of each tuple pair in the grouped list `list1` and list `list2` elements to list `list3`\nRelevant code documentation: python.library.operator#operator.itemgetter python operator itemgetter: Return a callable object that fetches item from its operand using the operand’s __getitem__() method. If multiple items are specified, returns a tuple of lookup values. For example python.library.functions#zip python zip: Make an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables. python.library.functools#functools.reduce python functools reduce: Apply function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of iterable, from left to right, so as to reduce the iterable to a single value. For example, reduce(lambda x, y: x+y, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) calculates ((((1+2)+3)+4)+5). The left argument, x, is the accumulated value and the right argument, y, is the update value from the iterable. If the optional initializer is present, it is placed before the items of the iterable in the calculation, and serves as a default when the iterable is empty. If initializer is not given and iterable contains only one item, the first item is returned. \nRationale: zip(list1, list2) makes an iterator of tuple pairs of the grouped list elements from list1 and list2. [(a + b) for a, b in zip(list1, list2)] makes a list of sums of each tuple pair in zip(list1, list2). list3 = [(a + b) for a, b in zip(list1, list2)] assigns this list of sums to list3. The answer is list3 = [(a + b) for a, b in zip(list1, list2)].\n\nQuery: Fit Kmeans function to a one-dimensional array `x` by reshaping it to be a multidimensional array of single values\nRelevant code documentation: numpy.reference.generated.numpy.matrix.reshape numpy matrix reshape: method: Returns an array containing the same data with a new shape. numpy.reference.generated.numpy.ufunc.reduce numpy ufunc reduce: method: Reduces array’s dimension by one, by applying ufunc along one axis. numpy.reference.generated.numpy.ndarray.reshape numpy ndarray reshape: method: Returns an array containing the same data with a new shape. \nRationale: ", "You are an expert language model in code generation.

The answer is df[df['A'].isin([3, 6])].\n\nQuery: convert list `data` into a string of its elements\nRelevant code documentation: python.library.stdtypes#str.join python str join: Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in iterable. A TypeError will be raised if there are any non-string values in iterable, including bytes objects. The separator between elements is the string providing this method. python.library.stdtypes#bytearray.join python bytearray join: Return a bytes or bytearray object which is the concatenation of the binary data sequences in iterable. A TypeError will be raised if there are any values in iterable that are not bytes-like objects, including str objects. The separator between elements is the contents of the bytes or bytearray object providing this method. python.library.stdtypes#bytes.join python bytes join: Return a bytes or bytearray object which is the concatenation of the binary data sequences in iterable. A TypeError will be raised if there are any values in iterable that are not bytes-like objects, including str objects. The separator between elements is the contents of the bytes or bytearray object providing this method. \nRationale: map(str, data) returns a new list where every element is the corresponding element of data, cast to a string. ''.join(map(str, data)) returns a string formed from the elements of data in order, joined by '', the empty string. This is a string of the elements of data. print(''.join(map(str, data))) prints the string of elements of data to the output stream. The answer is print(''.join(map(str, data))).\n\nQuery: replace white spaces in dataframe `df` with '_'\nRelevant code documentation: python.library.stdtypes#str.replace python str replace: Return a copy of the string with all occurrences of substring old replaced by new. If the optional argument count is given, only the first count occurrences are replaced. pandas.reference.api.pandas.dataframe.replace pandas dataframe replace: Replace values given in to_replace with value. pandas.reference.api.pandas.series.str.replace pandas series str replace: Replace each occurrence of pattern/regex in the Series/Index. \nRationale: ", "You are an expert language model in code generation.

The answer is print(''.join(map(str, data))).\n\nQuery: assign value in `group` dynamically to class property `attr`\nRelevant code documentation: python.library.functions#property python property: Return a property attribute. python.library.operator#operator.__setitem__ python operator __setitem__: Set the value of a at index b to c. python.library.functions#setattr python setattr: This is the counterpart of getattr(). The arguments are an object, a string and an arbitrary value. The string may name an existing attribute or a new attribute. The function assigns the value to the attribute, provided the object allows it. For example, setattr(x, 'foobar', 123) is equivalent to x.foobar = 123. \nRationale: ", "You are an expert language model in code generation.

The answer is df[df['A'].isin([3, 6])].\n\nQuery: Create list `instancelist` containing 29 objects of type MyClass\nRelevant code documentation: python.library.functions#isinstance python isinstance: Return True if the object argument is an instance of the classinfo argument, or of a (direct, indirect or virtual) subclass thereof. If object is not an object of the given type, the function always returns False. If classinfo is a tuple of type objects (or recursively, other such tuples), return True if object is an instance of any of the types. If classinfo is not a type or tuple of types and such tuples, a TypeError exception is raised. python.library.stdtypes#class.__subclasses__ python class __subclasses__: Each class keeps a list of weak references to its immediate subclasses. This method returns a list of all those references still alive. The list is in definition order. Example python.library.functions#object python object: Return a new featureless object. object is a base for all classes. It has the methods that are common to all instances of Python classes. This function does not accept any arguments. \nRationale: MyClass() instantiates new object of type MyClass. instancelist = [MyClass()] creates list ‘instancelist’ containing 1 object of type MyClass. instancelist = [MyClass() for i in range(29)] creates list ‘instancelist’ containing 29 objects of type MyClass. The answer is instancelist = [MyClass() for i in range(29)].\n\nQuery: sum the length of lists in list `x` that are more than 1 item in length\nRelevant code documentation: python.library.functions#sum python sum: Sums start and the items of an iterable from left to right and returns the total. The iterable’s items are normally numbers, and the start value is not allowed to be a string. python.library.collections#collections.Counter python collections Counter: A Counter is a dict subclass for counting hashable objects. It is a collection where elements are stored as dictionary keys and their counts are stored as dictionary values. Counts are allowed to be any integer value including zero or negative counts. The Counter class is similar to bags or multisets in other languages. python.library.functions#len python len: Return the length (the number of items) of an object. The argument may be a sequence (such as a string, bytes, tuple, list, or range) or a collection (such as a dictionary, set, or frozen set). \nRationale: ", 'You are an expert language model in code generation.

The elements of a set must be hashable. To represent sets of sets, the inner sets must be frozenset objects. If iterable is not specified, a new empty set is returned. python.library.functions#set python set: Return a new set object, optionally with elements taken from iterable. set is a built-in class.

If classinfo is a tuple of type objects (or recursively, other such tuples), return True if object is an instance of any of the types. If classinfo is not a type or tuple of types and such tuples, a TypeError exception is raised. python.library.stdtypes#class.__subclasses__ python class __subclasses__: Each class keeps a list of weak references to its immediate subclasses. This method returns a list of all those references still alive. The list is in definition order. Example python.library.functions#object python object: Return a new featureless object. object is a base for all classes. It has the methods that are common to all instances of Python classes. This function does not accept any arguments. \nRationale: MyClass() instantiates new object of type MyClass. instancelist = [MyClass()] creates list ‘instancelist’ containing 1 object of type MyClass. instancelist = [MyClass() for i in range(29)] creates list ‘instancelist’ containing 29 objects of type MyClass. The answer is instancelist = [MyClass() for i in range(29)].\n\nQuery: sum the length of lists in list `x` that are more than 1 item in length\nRelevant code documentation: python.library.functions#sum python sum: Sums start and the items of an iterable from left to right and returns the total. The iterable’s items are normally numbers, and the start value is not allowed to be a string. python.library.collections#collections.Counter python collections Counter: A Counter is a dict subclass for counting hashable objects. It is a collection where elements are stored as dictionary keys and their counts are stored as dictionary values. Counts are allowed to be any integer value including zero or negative counts. The Counter class is similar to bags or multisets in other languages. python.library.functions#len python len: Return the length (the number of items) of an object. The argument may be a sequence (such as a string, bytes, tuple, list, or range) or a collection (such as a dictionary, set, or frozen set). \nRationale: ", 'You are an expert language model in code generation.

If the optional initializer is present, it is placed before the items of the iterable in the calculation, and serves as a default when the iterable is empty. If initializer is not given and iterable contains only one item, the first item is returned. \nRationale: zip(list1, list2) makes an iterator of tuple pairs of the grouped list elements from list1 and list2. [(a + b) for a, b in zip(list1, list2)] makes a list of sums of each tuple pair in zip(list1, list2). list3 = [(a + b) for a, b in zip(list1, list2)] assigns this list of sums to list3.

If the optional argument count is given, only the first count occurrences are replaced. pandas.reference.api.pandas.dataframe.replace pandas dataframe replace: Replace values given in to_replace with value. pandas.reference.api.pandas.series.str.replace pandas series str replace: Replace each occurrence of pattern/regex in the Series/Index. \nRationale: ", "You are an expert language model in code generation. Come up with a series of rationales for code generation problems under the following specification. Given a query for a coding task and a list of code documentation, please reason through the provided documentation to arrive at the answer code and print the answer at the end of the output. A few examples of (query, relevant documentation, rationale) have been provided. Please emulate the format of the provided examples and return only the final rationale for the final query.\n\nQuery: append the sum of each tuple pair in the grouped list `list1` and list `list2` elements to list `list3`\nRelevant code documentation: python.library.operator#operator.itemgetter python operator itemgetter: Return a callable object that fetches item from its operand using the operand’s __getitem__() method. If multiple items are specified, returns a tuple of lookup values. For example python.library.functions#zip python zip: Make an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables. python.library.functools#functools.reduce python functools reduce: Apply function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of iterable, from left to right, so as to reduce the iterable to a single value. For example, reduce(lambda x, y: x+y, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) calculates ((((1+2)+3)+4)+5). The left argument, x, is the accumulated value and the right argument, y, is the update value from the iterable. If the optional initializer is present, it is placed before the items of the iterable in the calculation, and serves as a default when the iterable is empty. If initializer is not given and iterable contains only one item, the first item is returned. \nRationale: zip(list1, list2) makes an iterator of tuple pairs of the grouped list elements from list1 and list2. [(a + b) for a, b in zip(list1, list2)] makes a list of sums of each tuple pair in zip(list1, list2). list3 = [(a + b) for a, b in zip(list1, list2)] assigns this list of sums to list3. The answer is list3 = [(a + b) for a, b in zip(list1, list2)].\n\nQuery: convert list `data` into a string of its elements\nRelevant code documentation: python.library.stdtypes#str.join python str join: Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in iterable. A TypeError will be raised if there are any non-string values in iterable, including bytes objects. The separator between elements is the string providing this method. python.library.stdtypes#bytearray.join python bytearray join: Return a bytes or bytearray object which is the concatenation of the binary data sequences in iterable. A TypeError will be raised if there are any values in iterable that are not bytes-like objects, including str objects. The separator between elements is the contents of the bytes or bytearray object providing this method. python.library.stdtypes#bytes.join python bytes join: Return a bytes or bytearray object which is the concatenation of the binary data sequences in iterable. A TypeError will be raised if there are any values in iterable that are not bytes-like objects, including str objects. The separator between elements is the contents of the bytes or bytearray object providing this method. \nRationale: map(str, data) returns a new list where every element is the corresponding element of data, cast to a string. ''.join(map(str, data)) returns a string formed from the elements of data in order, joined by '', the empty string. This is a string of the elements of data. print(''.join(map(str, data))) prints the string of elements of data to the output stream. The answer is print(''.join(map(str, data))).\n\nQuery: assign value in `group` dynamically to class property `attr`\nRelevant code documentation: python.library.functions#property python property: Return a property attribute. python.library.operator#operator.__setitem__ python operator __setitem__: Set the value of a at index b to c. python.library.functions#setattr python setattr: This is the counterpart of getattr(). The arguments are an object, a string and an arbitrary value. The string may name an existing attribute or a new attribute. The function assigns the value to the attribute, provided the object allows it. For example, setattr(x, 'foobar', 123) is equivalent to x.foobar = 123. \nRationale: ", "You are an expert language model in code generation. Come up with a series of rationales for code generation problems under the following specification. Given a query for a coding task and a list of code documentation, please reason through the provided documentation to arrive at the answer code and print the answer at the end of the output. A few examples of (query, relevant documentation, rationale) have been provided. Please emulate the format of the provided examples and return only the final rationale for the final query.\n\nQuery: use a list of values `[3,6]` to select rows from a pandas dataframe `df`'s column 'A'\nRelevant code documentation: numpy.reference.generated.numpy.isin numpy isin: Calculates element in test_elements, broadcasting over element only. Returns a boolean array of the same shape as element that is True where an element of element is in test_elements and False otherwise. pandas.reference.api.pandas.dataframe.isin pandas dataframe isin: Whether each element in the DataFrame is contained in values. pandas.reference.api.pandas.series.isin pandas series isin: Whether elements in Series are contained in values. \nRationale: df[‘A’] returns `df`'s column 'A' as a pandas series. df[‘A’].isin([3, 6]) returns a pandas series of booleans where each boolean denotes whether the corresponding element of df[‘A’] is in the list of values [3, 6]. df[df['A'].isin([3, 6])] selects rows from `df` based on whether the value in column 'A' is contained in the list of values [3, 6]. The answer is df[df['A'].isin([3, 6])].\n\nQuery: Create list `instancelist` containing 29 objects of type MyClass\nRelevant code documentation: python.library.functions#isinstance python isinstance: Return True if the object argument is an instance of the classinfo argument, or of a (direct, indirect or virtual) subclass thereof. If object is not an object of the given type, the function always returns False. If classinfo is a tuple of type objects (or recursively, other such tuples), return True if object is an instance of any of the types. If classinfo is not a type or tuple of types and such tuples, a TypeError exception is raised. python.library.stdtypes#class.__subclasses__ python class __subclasses__: Each class keeps a list of weak references to its immediate subclasses. This method returns a list of all those references still alive. The list is in definition order. Example python.library.functions#object python object: Return a new featureless object. object is a base for all classes. It has the methods that are common to all instances of Python classes. This function does not accept any arguments. \nRationale: MyClass() instantiates new object of type MyClass. instancelist = [MyClass()] creates list ‘instancelist’ containing 1 object of type MyClass. instancelist = [MyClass() for i in range(29)] creates list ‘instancelist’ containing 29 objects of type MyClass. The answer is instancelist = [MyClass() for i in range(29)].\n\nQuery: sum the length of lists in list `x` that are more than 1 item in length\nRelevant code documentation: python.library.functions#sum python sum: Sums start and the items of an iterable from left to right and returns the total. The iterable’s items are normally numbers, and the start value is not allowed to be a string. python.library.collections#collections.Counter python collections Counter: A Counter is a dict subclass for counting hashable objects. It is a collection where elements are stored as dictionary keys and their counts are stored as dictionary values. Counts are allowed to be any integer value including zero or negative counts. The Counter class is similar to bags or multisets in other languages. python.library.functions#len python len: Return the length (the number of items) of an object. The argument may be a sequence (such as a string, bytes, tuple, list, or range) or a collection (such as a dictionary, set, or frozen set). \nRationale: ", 'You are an expert language model in code generation.

The answer is instancelist = [MyClass() for i in range(29)].\n\nQuery: append elements of a set `b` to a list `a`\nRelevant code documentation: python.library.collections#collections.deque.extend python collections deque extend: Extend the right side of the deque by appending elements from the iterable argument. python.library.stdtypes#set python set: Return a new set or frozenset object whose elements are taken from iterable. The elements of a set must be hashable. To represent sets of sets, the inner sets must be frozenset objects. If iterable is not specified, a new empty set is returned. python.library.functions#set python set: Return a new set object, optionally with elements taken from iterable. set is a built-in class. See set and Set Types — set, frozenset for documentation about this class. \nRationale: '] is not of type 'string' - 'messages.0.content'.
